##SQL Reporting Project \'96 Online Retail Dataset\

What this project is
This is a small end-to-end reporting project using the Online Retail dataset.  
The goal was to take raw transaction data and turn it into clean business reporting outputs (KPIs, trends, and customer insights) using SQL and Python.\
I used PostgreSQL (via pgAdmin) for the database layer and Jupyter Notebook for pulling the results, exporting them, and creating a couple of quick charts.\

What I built
1. Clean reporting layer
2. Reporting outputs
KPI Summary
Revenue Trend
Customer Performance
Retention Metric

Quick notes / assumptions\
- I excluded negative quantities and zero unit prices since they usually represent returns/cancellations or invalid rows.\
- Customer ID is required for customer-based reporting, so I filtered out rows where it was missing.\
